	<h3>Schedule and Attend Consultation</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			At the consultation, you will meet <b>one of our bankruptcy attorneys</b>. Together, both will review your credit report.
			After reviewing your scores, we will have you answer a series of questions unique to your situation. After our
			questioning, we will be able to tell you whether or not filing bankruptcy is best course of action. If so, which
			chapter would benefit you the most.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Complete the Credit Counselling Course</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			This course is an <b>online program</b> that can be completed at <b>your convenience</b>, but before your case is filed. It takes
			about an hour. This course is mandated by Congress for anyone filing bankruptcy.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Providing Documents Pertaining to the Case</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			If you choose to file bankruptcy, we will need a few documents. These documents include the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Most Recent State Tax Return</li>
				<li>Most Recent Federal Tax Return</li>
				<li>Proof of Income for the Last 6 Months</li>
			</ul>
			This is needed in order for us to prepare your Bankruptcy Petition and for your Bankruptcy Trustee to review.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Review and File Final Petition of Bankruptcy</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			From the documentation you provide, we will create your Bankruptcy Petition. We will sit down with you and review the
			petition with you <b>one final time</b>. Once the petition <b>complete and accurate</b>, we will file the petition with the court.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Attend a Bankruptcy Meeting</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			A month after filing, you will have a scheduled Bankruptcy Hearing. Your trustee will preside over the hearing. <b>One
			of our attorneys</b> will attend the hearing with you as well. The trustee will ask the <b>same questions</b> we have asked when
			you first began filing for bankruptcy. The trustee questioning will generally take <b>5 minutes or less</b>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Complete Second Credit Counselling Course</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			Following the hearing, the next step depends on which chapter you filed.
			<h4>Chapter 7</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Complete the Second Credit Counselling Course</li>
					<li>Wait 60 days for Discharge</li>
					<li>Your case closes shortly after Discharge</li>
